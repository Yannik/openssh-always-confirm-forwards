# What does this patch do?
This openssh patch makes ssh-agent always ask for confirmation when a remote server that the ssh-agent has been forwarded to tried to use one of your keys.
It will however not hassle you (unless you specifically use `ssh-add -c`) every time your local machine uses the ssh-agent to connect to a remote machine.

This improves ssh-agent forwarding alot.

# What should I use this for?
If you are connecting to a remote host over a jump host, use `ProxyCommand` instead of this!
Use this patch only if you need to transfer files directly between two remote servers and use it only temporarily by manuall connecting with `ssh -A`.

# Why should I use it?
Because agent forwarding is a big security risk, as the remote server can unbeknownst use your ssh-agent to tamper with other servers you have access to:

This can patch should secure you against that.

# Why shouldn't I use it?
Because I am definitely no expert in C and just hacked this together based on my dubious programming skills in other languages.

So, use it at your own risk!

# How to secure using ssh-agent a bit more:
Use [ssh-ident](https://github.com/ccontavalli/ssh-ident) to separate your identities!

While researching for this project, I also found [reverse-ssh-agent](https://github.com/ewindisch/reverse-ssh-agent) which seemed interesting too, but I did not review it.
